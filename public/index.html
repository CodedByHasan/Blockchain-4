        Sorry, we couldn't validate your document. Your file may never have

        true document

    <div id="technologyExplanation">
      <h1>How it works</h1>
      <p>
        This validation system utilises the Hedera Hasgraph blockchain to
        validate documents, allowing users to be sure that their file is the
        true, undoctored form of the document.
      </p>
      <p>Upon a document being uploaded, the system stores the document and
        generates a [Hash technology] hash from it. It then uses Hedera
        APIs to anchor this hash on the blockchain. In the future, when the same
        file is uploaded to the validation section, the system generates a
        hash again, and checks if this same hash exists on the blockchain. If
        so, the document is valid. If not, the file has either not been
        uploaded to the system before, or the document is invalid.
